# HandsFreeMediaControls
Hands Free Media Controls is an app that allows you control media playback by holding your hand over your phone.

## Overview
This app was created for people who want to quickly control music or video playback without having to touch their phones. It uses your phone's proximity sensor as a binary signal to cycle through media playback options. The process runs in a service, which means it can be used from any app without interruption.

Why would this ever be useful?

Let's say you are in the kitchen washing dishes or cooking food, it's pretty inconvenient to have to clean your hands every time you want to change songs or pause a video you have playing in the background. Or maybe you have your phone on your desk while working, and you want to switch songs with just the wave of your hand and get back to what your doing.
